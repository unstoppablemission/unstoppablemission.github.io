					<h2>Operation Backpack</h2>
					<p>All students deserve a good education, yet the majority of families who attend Liberty weren’t able to 
					fully equip their students to attend school. Our Operation Backpack program was created to do just that – 
					to equip the students for their upcoming school year by providing a backpack with all necessary school 
					supplies.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#care">More Info</button>
					<div id="care" class="collapse">
						<p>Operation Backpack takes place every July, where members and attendees of the church pick up a 
						backpack, purchase the supplies, and return them all packed and ready for the new school year. A 
						couple days prior to the school year, Liberty hosts a “Back to School Night” where students receive 
						their backpack. What seems to be a simple program and act of kindness to us ends up being a huge relief
						 to the families who do not have to worry about the costs of school supplies and not having their child
						  ready for school.</p>

					<h2>Holiday Meals</h2>
					<p>The Holidays are usually celebration where families gather around a table of food. For some, it can be 
					more of a burden as not all families can provide these holiday meals and gifts. As a church we want to come
					 together to celebrate with these families and bless them with meals and gifts during the holiday season.</p>

					<div id="meals" class="collapse">
						<p>For Thanksgiving, our Student Ministry hosts a night at Liberty to worship, play games, and interact
						 with the families. Each family is then sent home with all food items to cook a full Thanksgiving meal.</p>
						<p>For Christmas, the church hosts a special night at the school inviting families into share a meal 
						together. There is time for activities for the children and then an opportunity to pick out their own 
						Christmas gifts.</p>

					<h2>Nutrition Center</h2>
					<p>One of the first very visible needs around the Caiman area was combating malnourishment.  In order to do
					 this in an efficient way, feeding centers were begun where kids and families are able to come and receive 
					 a meal during the week.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#care">More Info</button>
					<div id="care" class="collapse">
						<p>These centers have also provided opportunities to teach the parents to plant

					<p>Merely handing out food has provided opportunities to share the gospel and to talk about how God’s word 
					is much greater than the basic necessities that we think that we need here on earth.</p>

					<h2>Orphan Care</h2>
					<p>In August of 2014 the Kingdom Cares Mission Center opened in Asikuma, Ghana to meet the need of the 
					orphan.  The Kingdom Cares Mission Center works directly with Social Welfare as well as other outreach 
					organizations to meet the long term care of abandoned children that have become orphaned.  </p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#care">More Info</button>
					<div id="care" class="collapse">
						<p>On average the Kingdom Cares Mission Center cares for about 20-40 children by providing them 
						housing, food, education, and overall daily care.  Many of the children that enter into the Mission 
						Center are also placed on the track for permanent adoption.</p>   
						<p>There are short term and long term mission opportunities available.  Please contact Jake Sullivan 
						at 515-291-1542 or via email

					<h2>Rehab/Discipleship Programs</h2>
					<p>In 2014 during one of our many trips to Cape Coast, Ghana we began an outreach program for those 
					addicted to drugs and/or those forced into prostitution and sex trafficking due to poverty.
					  As we began to reach out to the oppressed and the addicted it became obvious that simply sharing the 
					  Gospel was only the beginning.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#rehab">More Info</button>
					<div id="rehab" class="collapse">
						<p>We felt a call to begin to meet the physical needs in order to more effectively meet the spiritual 
						needs of the oppressed.  In January of 2015 the first discipleship/rehab homes were opened and by 
						September of 2015 a 21 bedroom complex was purchased to care for the men and women that have been 
						forced into a life of addiction and oppression.</p>
						<p>Each individual that is selected into the discipleship/rehab program goes through an intensive six 
						month withdrawal, discipleship, and training 
						program which guides these individuals in starting a new life found in Christ.</p>  
						<p>Upon graduation of the 
						program the graduate is awarded a $400.00 love-gift and assigned a mentor from the local church that 
						helps them use these funds to start sustainable small businesses so that they are not forced to return 
						to their former life.</p>  
						<p>There are short term and long term mission opportunities available.   Please
