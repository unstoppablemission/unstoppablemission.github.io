					<h2>Classroom Volunteers</h2>
					<p>Some teachers simply need extra hands in the classroom to assist the students and help with daily 
					activities. Therefore, individuals from the church congregation volunteer 3-4 hours per week to spend time 
					in a school classroom. This also allows students to get to the know the individual and may open a door for 
					a possible mentoring relationship.</p>

					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p>At both UCI and Touch of Hope there is an elementary school which are host to 660 and over 1,000 
					students respectively.  Currently, about half of the children in Haiti do not have the opportunity to 
					complete a primary education.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#education">More Info</button>
					<div id="education" class="collapse">   
						<p> Touch of Hope believes every child in their community should be able to attend school and therefore
						 charges a nominal fee (if the parents can afford it).  Breakfast and lunch are provided daily and for 
						 some it may be the only meal they get that day.   At UCI, the parents are encouraged to work once a 
						 month at the school to help pay back and invest in their child’s education.  The University at UCI is 
						 host to one of the leading medical programs in the country along with seminary students, agriculture, 
						 business, etc.   On all levels of schooling there is a scholarship program that allows students the 
						 opportunity to go to school.</p>
						<p>All university scholarship recipients have work study, behavioral, and academic requirements.  There
						 is a science lab, computer lab, and internet in all the classrooms, dissection lab and clinic, and 
						 extension training to build up well-rounded, well-trained students.</p>

					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p>In Ghana, Africa we have focused on educational development in three particular communities: Asikuma, 
					Tsipasi, and Cape Coast.</p>  
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#school">More Info</button>
					<div id="school" class="collapse">
						<p>In Asikuma, Ghana we help to operate a newly developed school that focuses on educating youth from a
						particular part of the community that has never had educational access.  Currently the school serves 
						over 160 kids from the community.</p>
						<p>The second community in which we are working is Tsipasi, Ghana.  We first entered Tsipasi in 2013 
						to meet a need for clean water.  In partnership with the Move Project two clean water 
						wells were opened in January of 2015.  As relationships were developed in the community we began to see
						the desperate need for education.  Over 97% of the community is illiterate and has never received 
						education above 5th grade.  In January of 2016 we will be opening the first organized school in Tsipasi
						as we begin the process of educating the youth in this community.</p>
						<p>The third community is Cape Coast, Ghana, where we partner with an already existing school called 
						Blessed Kiddies International.  Blessed Kiddies International supports education for orphaned and 
						abandoned children.  We have the vision to help Blessed Kiddies construct a new school structure by 
						2017 and to continue to help support them financially as they reach out to the most vulnerable youth 
						in their community. </p>
						<p>There are short term and long term mission opportunities available.   Please contact Jake Sullivan at

					<h2>Agriculture</h2>
					<p>In January of 2015 we began a partnership with <a href="http://www.agrihope.org" target="_blank">
					Agrihope</a> with the goal of making the Kingdom Cares Mission Campus in Asikuma, Ghana self-sustaining by 
					2024.</p>

					<div id="farming" class="collapse">
						<p><a href="http://www.agrihope.org" target="_blank">Agrihope</a> has been working in Zambia over the 
						past three years and has developed numerous leaders in 
						a method of farming called, “Farming Gods Way.”  This method of farming takes the natural resources and
						products that a typical African community would have access to and teaches them how to create higher 
						yields of crops.</p>
						<p>In August of 2015 <a href="http://www.agrihope.org" target="_blank">Agrihope</a> assigned one of 
						their primary leaders in Zambia to move to
						Asikuma, Ghana for a five year mission to help develop agriculture on the mission campus and to also 
						help the community with more sustainable farming methods.  Currently we grow beans, maze, and a variety 
						of citrus fruits.  <a href="http://www.agrihope.org" target="_blank">Agrihope</a> is also helping to

						<p>These businesses include catering, baking breads and cookies, and 
						sewing programs for women that produce backpacks, satchel bags, and purses.  These programs are in the infant 
						stages but long term efforts could produce a self-sustaining model for future outreach programs in Cape Coast.</p>
