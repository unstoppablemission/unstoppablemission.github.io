					<h2>Orphan Care</h2>
					<p>In August of 2014 the Kingdom Cares Mission Center opened in Asikuma, Ghana to meet the need of the orphan.  The Kingdom Cares Mission Center works directly with Social Welfare as well as other outreach organizations to meet the long term care of abandoned children that have become orphaned.  On average the Kingdom Cares Mission Center cares for between 20-40 children by providing them housing, food, education, and overall daily care.  Many of the children that enter into the Mission Center are also placed on the track for permanent adoption.   There are short term and long term mission opportunities available.  Please contact Jake Sullivan at 515-291-1542 or via email jakes@sunnybrookchurch.org  if you are interested in getting more involved.  In 2016 we will be starting a similar orphan ministry in Cape Coast, Ghana and will have more information as this program becomes solidified.</p>

					<h2>Rehab/Discipleship Programs</h2>
					<p>In 2014 during one of our many trips to Cape Coast, Ghana we began an outreach program for those that have become addicted to drugs and/or have been forced into prostitution and sex trafficking due to poverty.  As we began to reach out to the oppressed and the addicted it became obvious that simply sharing the Gospel was only the beginning.  We felt a call to begin to meet the physical needs in order to more effectively meet the spiritual needs of the oppressed.   In January of 2015 the first discipleship/rehab homes were opened and by September of 2015 a 21 bedroom complex was purchased to care for the men and women that have been forced into a life of addiction and oppression.  Each individual that is selected into the discipleship/rehab program goes through an intensive six month withdrawal, discipleship, and training program which guides these individuals in starting a new life found in Christ.  Upon graduation of the program the graduate is awarded a $400.00 love-gift and assigned a mentor from the local church that helps them use these funds to start sustainable small businesses so that they are not forced to return to their former life.  There are short term and long term mission opportunities available.   Please contact Jake Sullivan at 515-291-1542 or via email jakes@sunnybrookchurch.org if you are interested in getting more involved.</p>
