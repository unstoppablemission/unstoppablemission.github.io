				<h1>ADVOCATE</h1>
					<p>The West Side of Sioux City is 
					seen as one of the poorest and most diverse communities in the area. However, many people living right here in 
					Siouxland are not aware of these circumstances or choose to ignore it. Currently, there are many other 
					business and organizations who are either located directly in or very close to this community. Through 
					partnering relationships, our vision is to educate and expose these front-line people on the specific needs
					 of the community in hopes to open their eyes to the community and ultimately provide long-term development. 
					</p>
					<div class="advocate-highlight">
						<h3>Liberty Elementary School</h3>
						<p> Sunnybrook’s partnership with Liberty Elementary in the West Side of Sioux City began back in 2007 
						when the school was formerly known 
					as Everett Elementary. We initially recognized the need for this community of students and began meeting 
					some of the immediate needs, such as providing backpacks for the students to go to school. <i>The school has 
					been acknowledged as 100% free and reduced</i>…Since then, we have created a more consistent presence with the 
					school by putting on multiple events throughout the year there. Our vision is to create lasting 
					relationships with the students and their families in hopes to provide long-term change in this specific 
					community on the West side of Sioux City.</p>

				<h1>ADVOCATE</h1>
					<p>For the past 10 years Sunnybrook has been dedicated to meeting the needs in multiple communities within 
					the country of Haiti.  Our partnership began with Promise For Haiti in Pignon which created a lot of 
					opportunities to meet peoples’ medical, educational, and physical needs leading to the opportunity to share
					 the gospel.  Because of stepping out in faith in going to Haiti God has blessed us from taking 1 trip per 
					 year to 4 and expanding our partnerships.  We support both <a href="http://ucihaiti.org/" target="_blank">UCI (United Christians International)</a> in Caiman
					  Haiti as well as <a href="http://touchofhopehaiti.com/" target="_blank">Touch of Hope</a> in Simonette, Haiti.   Our desire is to come alongside existing 
					  organizations and expedite their goals by way of physical and financial support.  
					</p>
					<div class="advocate-highlight">
						<h3>Orphan Care</h3>
						<p> <a href="http://www.tytoogardens.com/" target="_blank">Tytoo Gardens</a> in Simonette is an orphanage and outreach center that Touch of Hope operates and is 
						the home to 38 orphans that are largely unable to be adopted.   During their time in the orphanage 
						these kids have had various medical, emotional, and spiritual needs that are addressed in a number of 
						different ways. Their Transition Program helps the young adults become independent after leaving the 
						orphanage.</p>
						<h3>The Church</h3>
						<p> In the Caiman community evangelizing to the Vodou community has helped eradicate Satan’s influence 
						on the culture there. In addition they are also making disciples of multiple ages through youth, 
						children, and adult programs.  In addition, there has been training given to lay pastors in over 60 
						different churches in the surrounding communities.</p> 
						<p>At Touch of Hope we continue to support and empower a local community church to be the hands and 
						feet of Christ to the community of Simonette.</p>

				<h1>ADVOCATE</h1>
					<p>We believe that as Christians we have a responsibility to be a voice for the oppressed, a place for the
					orphan, and relief for the widow.  The Lord’s Word is filled with this command.</p>
					<div class="advocate-highlight">
						<h3>Isaiah 1:17</h3>
						<p> Learn to do right; seek justice.  Defend the oppressed.  Take up the cause of the 
						fatherless; please the case of the widow.</p>  
						<h3>Isaiah 58:10</h3>
						<p>If you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, 
						then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like the noonday.</p>
						<h3>James 1:27</h3>
						<p>Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after the 
						orphan and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</p>
					</div>
					<p>When you join us on mission in Ghana, Africa not only are you choosing to be a voice for the oppressed 
					and the loving arms for the orphan but you are choosing to be a light of advocacy to your local church, in 
					your neighborhoods, and in your work places.  When we put our faith in Christ we have also made a 
					proclamation to spend ourselves on behalf of the oppressed to be a light for Christ in the darkest places 
					of this world.</p>   
					<p>If you want to join us in being that light and being that voice amongst the nations please contact Jake 
					Sullivan at 515-291-1542 or via email
