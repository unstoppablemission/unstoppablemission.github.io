				<h1>ADVOCATE</h1>
					<p>The West Side of Sioux City, where Liberty Elementary is located, is 
					seen as one of the poorest and diverse communities in the area. However, many people living right here in 
					Siouxland are not aware of these circumstances or choose to ignore it. Currently, there are many other 
					business and organizations who are either located directly in or very close to this community. Through 
					partnering relationships, our vision is to educate and expose these front-line people on the specific needs
					 of the community in hopes to open their eyes to the community and ultimately provide long-term development. 
					</p>
					<div class="Liberty">
						<h3>Liberty Elementary School</h3>
						<p> Sunnybrook’s partnership with Liberty Elementary began back in 2007 when the school was formerly known 
					as Everett Elementary. We initially recognized the need for this community of students and began meeting 
					some of the immediate needs, such as providing backpacks for the students to go to school. <i>The school has 
					been acknowledged as 100% free and reduced</i>…Since then, we have created a more consistent presence with the 
					school by putting on multiple events throughout the year there. Our vision is to create lasting 
					relationships with the students and their families in hopes to provide long-term change in this specific 
					community on the West side of Sioux City.</p>

					<h2>Operation Backpack</h2>
					<p>All students deserve a good education, yet the majority of families who attend Liberty weren’t able to 
					fully equip their students to attend school. Our Operation Backpack program was created to do just that – 
					to equip the students for their upcoming school year by providing a backpack with all necessary school 
					supplies.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#care">More Info</button>
					<div id="care" class="collapse">
						<p>Operation Backpack takes place every July, where members and attendees of the church pick up a 
						backpack, purchase the supplies, and return them all packed and ready for the new school year. A 
						couple days prior to the school year, Liberty hosts a “Back to School Night” where students receive 
						their backpack. What seems to be a simple program and act of kindness to us ends up being a huge relief
						 to the families who do not have to worry about the costs of school supplies and not having their child
						  ready for school.</p>

					<h2>Holiday Meals</h2>
					<p>The Holidays are usually celebration where families gather around a table of food. For some, it can be 
					more of a burden as not all families can provide these holiday meals and gifts. As a church we want to come
					 together to celebrate with these families and bless them with meals and gifts during the holiday season.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#meals">More Info</button>
					<div id="meals" class="collapse">
						<p>For Thanksgiving, our Student Ministry hosts a night at Liberty to worship, play games, and interact
						 with the families. Each family is then sent home with all food items to cook a full Thanksgiving meal.</p>
						<p>For Christmas, the church hosts a special night at the school inviting families into share a meal 
						together. There is time for activities for the children and then an opportunity to pick out their own 
						Christmas gifts.</p>

					<h2>End of the Year Carnival</h2>
					<p>Each May at the end of the school year, we spend one night celebrating another successful school year 
					with the students and their families. This event is filled with fun games, food, and services 
					(i.e. haircuts, massages, etc.). It is a joy to celebrate with these families each year!</p>

					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p>In Ghana, Africa we have focused on educational development in three particular communities: Asikuma, 
					Tsipasi, and Cape Coast.</p>  
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#education">More Info</button>
					<div id="education" class="collapse">
						<p>In Asikuma, Ghana we help to operate a newly developed school that focuses on educating youth from a
						particular part of the community that has never had educational access.  Currently the school serves 
						over 160 kids from the community.</p>
						<p>The second community in which we are working is Tsipasi, Ghana.  We first entered Tsipasi in 2013 
						to meet a need for clean water.  In partnership with the Move Project two clean water 
						wells were opened in January of 2015.  As relationships were developed in the community we began to see
						the desperate need for education.  Over 97% of the community is illiterate and has never received 
						education above 5th grade.  In January of 2016 we will be opening the first organized school in Tsipasi
						as we begin the process of educating the youth in this community.</p>
						<p>The third community is Cape Coast, Ghana, where we partner with an already existing school called 
						Blessed Kiddies International.  Blessed Kiddies International supports education for orphaned and 
						abandoned children.  We have the vision to help Blessed Kiddies construct a new school structure by 
						2017 and to continue to help support them financially as they reach out to the most vulnerable youth 
						in their community. </p>
						<p>There are short term and long term mission opportunities available.   Please contact Jake Sullivan at 
						515-291-1542 or via email <a href="mailto:jakes@sunnybrookchurch.org?Subject=Unstoppable%20Mission%20Interest" target="_top">jakes@sunnybrookchurch.org</a> if you are interested in getting more involved.</p>

					<h2>Agriculture</h2>
					<p>In January of 2015 we began a partnership with <a href="http://www.agrihope.org" target="_blank">
					Agrihope</a> with the goal of making the Kingdom Cares Mission Campus in Asikuma, Ghana self-sustaining by 
					2024.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#agriculture">More Info</button>
					<div id="agriculture" class="collapse">
						<p><a href="http://www.agrihope.org" target="_blank">Agrihope</a> has been working in Zambia over the 
						past three years and has developed numerous leaders in 
						a method of farming called, “Farming Gods Way.”  This method of farming takes the natural resources and
						products that a typical African community would have access to and teaches them how to create higher 
						yields of crops.</p>
						<p>In August of 2015 <a href="http://www.agrihope.org" target="_blank">Agrihope</a> assigned one of 
						their primary leaders in Zambia to move to
						Asikuma, Ghana for a five year mission to help develop agriculture on the mission campus and to also 
						help the community with more sustainable farming methods.  Currently we grow beans, maze, and a variety 
						of citrus fruits.  <a href="http://www.agrihope.org" target="_blank">Agrihope</a> is also helping to 
						develop an operating chicken and goat farm.</p>

					<h2>Small Business</h2>
					<p>Helping graduates develop small businesses is a major part of the rehab/discipleship program in Cape 
					Coast, Ghana.</p>

					<div id="business" class="collapse">
						<p>Not only do we focus on helping the graduates of our programs set up small businesses to provide a 
						new life away from drugs and prostitution, but we also desire to create business development inside the 
						Cape Coast Mission Center.</p>
						<p>These businesses include catering, baking breads and cookies, and 
						sewing programs for women that produce backpacks, satchel bags, and purses.  These programs are in the infant 
						stages but long term efforts could produce a self-sustaining model for future outreach programs in Cape Coast.</p>
