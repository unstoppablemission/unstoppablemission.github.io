				<h1>ADVOCATE</h1>
					<p>We believe that as Christians we have a responsibility to be a voice for the oppressed, a place for the
					orphan, and relief for the widow.  The Lord’s Word is filled with this command.</p>
					<div class="scripture">
						<h3>Isaiah 1:17</h3>
						<p> Learn to do right; seek justice.  Defend the oppressed.  Take up the cause of the 
						fatherless; please the case of the widow.</p>  
						<h3>Isaiah 58:10</h3>
						<p>If you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, 
						then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like the noonday.</p>
						<h3>James 1:27</h3>
						<p>Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after the 
						orphan and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</p>
					</div>
					<p>When you join us on mission in Ghana, Africa not only are you choosing to be a voice for the oppressed 
					and the loving arms for the orphan but you are choosing to be a light of advocacy to your local church, in 
					your neighborhoods, and in your work places.  When we put our faith in Christ we have also made a 
					proclamation to spend ourselves on behalf of the oppressed to be a light for Christ in the darkest places 
					of this world.</p>   
					<p>If you want to join us in being that light and being that voice amongst the nations please contact Jake 
					Sullivan at 515-291-1542 or via email

					<h2>Orphan Care</h2>
					<p>In August of 2014 the Kingdom Cares Mission Center opened in Asikuma, Ghana to meet the need of the 
					orphan.  The Kingdom Cares Mission Center works directly with Social Welfare as well as other outreach 
					organizations to meet the long term care of abandoned children that have become orphaned.  </p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#care">More Info</button>
					<div id="care" class="collapse">
						<p>On average the Kingdom Cares Mission Center cares for about 20-40 children by providing them 
						housing, food, education, and overall daily care.  Many of the children that enter into the Mission 
						Center are also placed on the track for permanent adoption.</p>   
						<p>There are short term and long term mission opportunities available.  Please contact Jake Sullivan 
						at 515-291-1542 or via email
						<a href="mailto:jakes@sunnybrookchurch.org?Subject=Unstoppable%20Mission%20Interest" target="_top">
						jakes@sunnybrookchurch.org</a> if you are interested in getting more involved.</p>
						<p>In 2016 we will be 
						starting a similar orphan ministry in Cape Coast, Ghana and will have more information as this program 
						becomes solidified.</p>

					<h2>Rehab/Discipleship Programs</h2>
					<p>In 2014 during one of our many trips to Cape Coast, Ghana we began an outreach program for those 
					addicted to drugs and/or those forced into prostitution and sex trafficking due to poverty.
					  As we began to reach out to the oppressed and the addicted it became obvious that simply sharing the 
					  Gospel was only the beginning.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#rehab">More Info</button>
					<div id="rehab" class="collapse">
						<p>We felt a call to begin to meet the physical needs in order to more effectively meet the spiritual 
						needs of the oppressed.  In January of 2015 the first discipleship/rehab homes were opened and by 
						September of 2015 a 21 bedroom complex was purchased to care for the men and women that have been 
						forced into a life of addiction and oppression.</p>
						<p>Each individual that is selected into the discipleship/rehab program goes through an intensive six 
						month withdrawal, discipleship, and training 
						program which guides these individuals in starting a new life found in Christ.</p>  
						<p>Upon graduation of the 
						program the graduate is awarded a $400.00 love-gift and assigned a mentor from the local church that 
						helps them use these funds to start sustainable small businesses so that they are not forced to return 
						to their former life.</p>  
						<p>There are short term and long term mission opportunities available.   Please 
						contact Jake Sullivan at 515-291-1542 or via email 
						<a href="mailto:jakes@sunnybrookchurch.org?Subject=Unstoppable%20Mission%20Interest" target="_top">

					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p>In Ghana, Africa we have focused on educational development in three particular communities: Asikuma, 
					Tsipasi, and Cape Coast.</p>  
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#education">More Info</button>
					<div id="education" class="collapse">
						<p>In Asikuma, Ghana we help to operate a newly developed school that focuses on educating youth from a
						particular part of the community that has never had educational access.  Currently the school serves 
						over 160 kids from the community.</p>
						<p>The second community in which we are working is Tsipasi, Ghana.  We first entered Tsipasi in 2013 
						to meet a need for clean water.  In partnership with the Move Project two clean water 
						wells were opened in January of 2015.  As relationships were developed in the community we began to see
						the desperate need for education.  Over 97% of the community is illiterate and has never received 
						education above 5th grade.  In January of 2016 we will be opening the first organized school in Tsipasi
						as we begin the process of educating the youth in this community.</p>
						<p>The third community is Cape Coast, Ghana, where we partner with an already existing school called 
						Blessed Kiddies International.  Blessed Kiddies International supports education for orphaned and 
						abandoned children.  We have the vision to help Blessed Kiddies construct a new school structure by 
						2017 and to continue to help support them financially as they reach out to the most vulnerable youth 
						in their community. </p>
						<p>There are short term and long term mission opportunities available.   Please contact Jake Sullivan at 
						515-291-1542 or via email <a href="mailto:jakes@sunnybrookchurch.org?Subject=Unstoppable%20Mission%20Interest" target="_top">jakes@sunnybrookchurch.org</a> if you are interested in getting more involved.</p>

					<h2>Agriculture</h2>
					<p>In January of 2015 we began a partnership with <a href="http://www.agrihope.org" target="_blank">
					Agrihope</a> with the goal of making the Kingdom Cares Mission Campus in Asikuma, Ghana self-sustaining by 
					2024.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#agriculture">More Info</button>
					<div id="agriculture" class="collapse">
						<p><a href="http://www.agrihope.org" target="_blank">Agrihope</a> has been working in Zambia over the 
						past three years and has developed numerous leaders in 
						a method of farming called, “Farming Gods Way.”  This method of farming takes the natural resources and
						products that a typical African community would have access to and teaches them how to create higher 
						yields of crops.</p>
						<p>In August of 2015 <a href="http://www.agrihope.org" target="_blank">Agrihope</a> assigned one of 
						their primary leaders in Zambia to move to
						Asikuma, Ghana for a five year mission to help develop agriculture on the mission campus and to also 
						help the community with more sustainable farming methods.  Currently we grow beans, maze, and a variety 
						of citrus fruits.  <a href="http://www.agrihope.org" target="_blank">Agrihope</a> is also helping to 
						develop an operating chicken and goat farm.</p>
						<p>There are short term and long term mission opportunities available.   Please contact Jake Sullivan

					<h2>Small Business</h2>
					<p>Helping graduates develop small businesses is a major part of the rehab/discipleship program in Cape 
					Coast, Ghana.</p>					
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#business">More Info</button>
					<div id="business" class="collapse">
						<p>Not only do we focus on helping the graduates of our programs set up small businesses to provide a 
						new life away from drugs and prostitution, but we also desire to create business development inside the 
						Cape Coast Mission Center.</p>
						<p>These businesses include catering, baking breads and cookies, and 
						sewing programs for women that produce backpacks, satchel bags, and purses.  These programs are in the infant 
						stages but long term efforts could produce a self-sustaining model for future outreach programs in Cape Coast.</p>
